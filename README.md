Measuring the Status of Charge (SoC) on Pi
## problem
The Li-ion battery voltage does not linearly correlate with the State of Charge (SoC) during dynamic loading conditions is crucial for battery management systems. This is because, under load, the battery voltage can drop due to internal resistance, and it may not accurately reflect the true SoC. When the load is removed, the voltage may recover slightly, but still, this voltage is not a direct indicator of SoC, especially in dynamic conditions.<img width="437" alt="image" src="https://github.com/itemhsu/BatteryPi/assets/25599185/abc12d77-91a8-44d8-b9ea-5b7a1ed1ce84">
